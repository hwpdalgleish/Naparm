# Naparm
_(Near automatic photoactivation response mapping)_

Written by: Lloyd Russell ([@llerussell](https://github.com/llerussell/)) and Henry WP Dalgleish ([@hwpdalgleish](https://github.com/hwpdalgleish/)) in Michael Hausser's laboratory (UCL)

Complete software suite to select photostimulation targets manually, or automatically, from anatomical or activity-based images or volumetric stacks. See [STAMovieMaker](https://github.com/llerussell/STAMovieMaker) for generation of stimulus triggered average pixel maps. 
This software will generate SLM phase masks, galvanometer positioning and Pockels cell control protocols to be executed by the photostimulation modules of an all-optical microscope (using software: PrairieView [Bruker Corporation] and Blink [Meadowlark])
